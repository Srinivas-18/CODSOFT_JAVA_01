This Java program implements the number game with the following features:

-Generates a random number within a specified range (1 to 100)

-Prompts the user to enter their guess for the generated number

-Compares the user's guess with the generated number and provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low

-Limits the number of attempts the user has to guess the number (6 attempts)

-Allows the user to play multiple rounds

-Displays the user's score, which is based on the number of rounds won.
